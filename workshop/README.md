## Optional Transfer Knowledge activity

The Computer Vision service provides many capabilities that you can use to analyze images, including generating a descriptive caption, extracting relevant tags, identifying objects, determining image type and metadata, detecting human faces, known brands, and celebrities, and others.

You can find out more about using the Computer Vision service in the [service documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/).

With Power Apps, you can:
Build an app quickly by using the skills that you already have.
Connect to the cloud services and data sources that you're already using.
Share your apps instantly so that coworkers can use them on their phones and tablets.
